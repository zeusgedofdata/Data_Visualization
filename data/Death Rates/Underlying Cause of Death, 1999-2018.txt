"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"5. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
